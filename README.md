# ☎️ Telco Customer Churn - ML Project (Part 2)

This project analyses customer churn behavior in the telecom industry, data provided by Kaggle. The project is split into two parts, first part I used SQL on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, where the goal was to clean the dataset, explore patterns related to churn and customer behavior. The second part will involve building a neural network and make prediction on churn. 

- 📂 The dataset used in this project is available via Kaggle: \
