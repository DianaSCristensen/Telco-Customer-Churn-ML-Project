# ☎️ Telco-Customer-Churn-ML-Project (Part 2)

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in the telecom industry, data provided by Kaggle. The project is split into two parts, first part I used SQL on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, where the goal was to clean the dataset, explore patterns related to churn and customer behavior. The second part will involve building a Neural Network and make prediction on churn.
